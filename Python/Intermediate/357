## Misread question and need to change n to be a ratio input rather than number of cycles

import itertools

numbers = ["1","2"]
cyclenumbers = itertools.cycle(numbers)
nextnum = next(cyclenumbers)

def kola(n):
    sequence = "1"
    startsequence = 0
    for i in cyclenumbers:
        if n > 0:
            lastnum = int(sequence[startsequence]) # retrieves the lastest run
            startsequence += 1
            appendage = (lastnum * i) # works out the next sequence to attatch
            sequence += appendage
            # print(sequence)
            # print(i)
            # print (n)
            n -= 1
        else:
            break
    finalsequence = (sequence[:2]+sequence[1:]) # fudge fix
    ratio1 = finalsequence.count("1")
    ratio2 = finalsequence.count("2")
    print(str(ratio1)+":"+str(ratio2))
    
kola(65)
